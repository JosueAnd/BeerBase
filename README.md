### Java & SQLite
BeerBase is an application for the Android platform that shows basic information for a large number of hops based beverages. It utilizes a sample database of approximately 2,000 beverages I put together in SQLite Studio and allows the user to search for a specific beer by name or a list of beverages provided by a specific brewery.
